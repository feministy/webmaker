With these resources and a little time, you can teach yourself how to build web apps. Web Maker is a cultivated collection of resources that are designed to take you from zero or very little knowledge about web development to someone who can develop their own web apps. All you need is a Mac (preferably up-to-date), Google Chrome, the internet, and time.
