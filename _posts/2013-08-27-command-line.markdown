**Required reading**

[Learn the Command Line the Hard Way](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/)

**Why do I have to learn the command line, Liz? There are GUIs for everything.**

There aren't actually GUIs for everything. When you make your first web app and decide to share it with the world, you have to deploy it to the web. This means you have to use the command line to work with servers and all sorts of other magical stuff. You can't do this with a GUI.

Basically: you can't be a web developer if you don't learn the command line. Period. Seriously. Learn it.
