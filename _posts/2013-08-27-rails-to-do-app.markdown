**Pre-requisites: you know Rails.**

[Rails Girls App Tutorial](http://guides.railsgirls.com/app/)

*Important note about the tutorial*

The tutorial uses scaffolding to get you up and running. This is ok for your first app, but it's not common practice in a development environment. And by "not common practice", I mean that it's generally frowned upon.
